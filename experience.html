        <h4>Intern</h4>
        <h5>September 2015 - Present</h5><br>

        <p>In my time at the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History I have been taken up several roles in day to day operations and and projects. Most recently, I have been involved with a collaboration between the Museum and the  Bentley Historical Library to secure documents for archiving, have helped create a records schedule, and have appraised Museum records furthering my knowledge of archival practice. This has also required me to facilitate changes in the organization of Museum staff files and leading staff through the process of digital migration.</p><br>

        <p>Aside from this project, I have also assisted in cataloguing items and creating entries in the Educational Collections database as a part of the Museum's move to a new facility furthering my collections management experience. In the Museum's effort to develop new exhibit, I also assited in the prototyping and assessment of proposed exhibition demos for the new Museum. I also worked to update the staff organizational chart gaining furthering my project, and facilitated the recent time capsule project. Both of these experiences have furthered my project management skills.</p><br>

        <p>I also have extensive experience in the educational programming that occurs at the Museum. I have created activities for schools as Pre- and Post-visit lessons furthering my project management proficiency and content expertise through a teaching experience. I have also update Discovery Guides for visitors to complete on their visit at the Museum, have given guided tours on prehistoric life to school groups expanding upon public speaking and management skills, and have led events such as “Learn it Do it” days and birthday parties for schools and the public advancing my event management capabilities. In the Summer of 2018 I served as a Camp Explorations and Neuroscience Camp counselor for elementary and middle school children.</p><br>

        <p>Other day to day operations that I have participated in have been leading the Museum as Staff Docent, participating in Museum board meetings as elected Student Docent Representative from 2017-2018, and worked in the Museum Store.</p>

        <h4>Summer Graduate Intern - Department of Gallery Archives</h4>
        <h5>June - August 2019</h5><br>

        <p>In the summer of 2019 I had the fortunate opportunity to intern with the National Gallery of Art's Department of Gallery Archives. While there, I worked on a total of three projects. One of them involved scrapbooks that contain press clippings from 1937 to 1986. This collection contains over 300 volumes of scrapbooks of different materials (physically and content-wise). The most major issues with these scrapbooks were those related to preservation. To name a few, these scrapbooks had issues with warped pages, clippings that had come loose from their original pages, and adhesive residue and stains on the pages. In approaching this project, I conducted a report utilizing a sample of scrapbooks from the collection. After assessing the collection, I completed a rehousing demonstration in which I removed the contents of two scrapbooks and placed them in archival folders and boxes. This required placing the loose materials in plastic sleeves, and placing them behind their original pages in the folders. I also experimented with photocopying the pages in their original states (with the loose clippings in their original spots).</p><br>

        <p>Another major project I participated in while with Gallery Archives was preparing materials for migration to NetX. This project was a collaboration with the Gallery's Division of Imaging and Visual Services to prepare metadata for exportation into the Gallery’s new DAM system. This collection totals around 50,000 objects, and explicit work involved the reconciliation of access and preservation versions of assets, the investigation of audio files, combining PDFs, and editing and correcting metadata in Excel. This also gave me the opportunity to write MARC records, as well as provide input into new software to be acquired by the Gallery Archives.</p><br>

        <p>Third, I helped with the acquisition and inventory of the another department's files to the Archives. Tasks for this project included the physical transfer of the files from said department's offices, the investigation of each file for metadata and scope/content information, and then separating the files into three categories (retain, return, and missing). In the end, 10 cubic feet of files were retained by Gallery Archives, with less than 4 cubic feet being returned to the other department. This smaller group was then physically returned to the department's offices.</p><br>

        <p>Along with these three major projects, I also helped Gallery Archives Staff with general tasks. These included pulling materials from G-76, participating in meetings between GA and other departments, as well as watching visiting researchers.</p>

        <h4>LSA IT NAGPRA Intern</h4>
        <h5>April 2017 - June 2018</h5><br>

        <p> For over a year I worked for the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropological Archaeology as an IT Intern for their operations around the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. In this position I advanced my database management skills by entering and maintaining information from reports on Native American artifacts and remains. I also developed my collections management skills by handling and preparing artifacts for consultation by different Native American tribe elders and members, and provided input on the development and infrastructure of the database used.</p>
